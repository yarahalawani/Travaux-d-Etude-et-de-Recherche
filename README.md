The objective of this work is to develop a Q-learning-based strategy to identify attack strategies against autonomous vehicles and reveal potential system vulnerabilities for improvement. 
In the context of Intelligent Transportation Systems, autonomous vehicles are susceptible to cyber-attacks that could compromise vehicle control and safety.
Therefore, the goal is to train a machine learning model to discover the most effective attack strategies against these systems, enabling early vulnerability detection and mitigation.

The work includes a brief review of Q-learning algorithm variants, selection of a suitable variant for the problem, implementation of an open-source version of the selected algorithm, 
and application to a test modelâ€‹
